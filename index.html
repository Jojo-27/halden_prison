                                Halden Prison, the second-largest one in Norway, was founded in 2010 with a strong desire to
                                make rehabilitation possible for its inmates with “real life simulations”.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At first, it can seem crazy or even unimaginable to think about building a real town inside a
                                prison for dangerous criminals such as rapists, murderers, child molesters or drug offenders.
                                Indeed, this is what makes Halden Prison very special, different from the other ones.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Designed in the image of a kind of small village, this prison aims at creating a “mirror”
                                between life inside and outside the blocks. Therefore, you can find out painted walls with
                                different kinds of arts, realistic streets, and many buildings.

                                As every place you can live in, many infrastructures have been built, such as a school, a library,
                                a workplace, and even a football field. The place has been thought so that everyone can do all
                                kinds of activities, like studying, reading, playing music, practicing some sports.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                This ideal life is the reason why the inmates are free and encouraged to spend as much time
                                as possible outside all day long. No matter what you did before or who you are, Halden Prison
                                reminds you first of what it is to have human rights.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <div class="textImage">
                                <img src="resources/IMG_0720.JPG">

                                Living in this place as an inmate seems to be utopian. For instance, 10m² of living-room equipped
                                by a flat-screen TV, a desk, a mini-fridge, a toilet with a shower, with a common kitchen and dinning room.
                                Everything you need has been made available so you are free to cook your own meals.

                                Relationships are also important for the inmates. Receiving families, partners or friends privately is allowed
                                twice a week and for two hours. This bridge between life inside and outside the blocks has been
                                made so that every inmates don’t fall into any kind of depression.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                “Dynamic security”, that is also what makes Halden Prison different from the other ones.
                                Staff members such as teachers, healthcare workers, personal trainers and even guards, are
                                pushed to create interpersonal relationships with the inmates. As a consequence, they can spend
                                their time doing activities together, get to know each other, and create a daily strong routine.

                            <p>
                                Despite this ideal life for its inmates, the architects of Halden Prison made sure about putting
                                in place a high security measure inside the blocks. The big grey walls, visible everywhere around
                                this place, has been solidly built in the image of a real deterrent for the inmates. Behind this
                                wall is the real thing that they lost: “Freedom”.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Halden Prison is considered as “the place-to-be” for many people in the world, because of the treatment given to its inmates.
                                Nevertheless, it has a huge security system that remains stable and efficient against escape until today in Norway.
                                Secured place, but also ideal inside for dangerous criminals, offering many opportunities to escape… Now, the question is:
                                For how long will Halden Prison remain a safe place?
